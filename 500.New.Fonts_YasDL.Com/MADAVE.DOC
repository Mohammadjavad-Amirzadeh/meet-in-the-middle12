                             Madison Avenue
                              Documentation

INSTALLATION:
------------

Luckily there isn't much documentation needed to effectively use the
Madison Avenue font in Windows 3.1. In fact what documentation you need
you already have.

To activate TrueType fonts, copy them to your WINDOWS/SYSTEM directory and
activate them via the Control Panel - Fonts menu.

To activate PostScript Type 1 fonts, copy the *.PFB to your PSFONTS and
the *.PFM to your PSFONTS/PFM subdirectories and activate them via ATM.
We have included .AFM, .CFG, and .INF files for your use if your
particular non-windows setup needs them but if you are using Windows you
can ignore these small files.

Using these fonts within other systems will require installation as
outlined in the documentation of those systems.


THE FONT:
---------

MADAVE is generally a decorative Sans Serif font modeled after Solotype's
Advertiser Gothic Light. You'll find it a swoopy, effective font for
promotional pieces, advertisements, etc.

This is a fully hinted font - including diagonal hints in the TrueType
set. It uses composite characters wherever possible to conserve resources
and increase printing speed.
