DMPLAS    A 6k TSR that translates IBM/Epson printer output to HP LaserJet
          (PCL) standards. Works with both text and graphics. DMPLAS can
          reproduce exactly formatted print both horizontally and
          vertically (good for filling in forms) or the vertical aspect
          can be shrunk by 10% to accommodate the LaserJet's 10-inch page.

          DMPLAS can also be used in stand-alone mode to translate and
          print pre-formatted output.

          A set of optional HP LaserJet soft fonts are included that can
          produce more accurate results on printers that do not have a
          full range of fonts. Included are normal, bold, italic, and
          italic bold fonts as well as a full set of proportional Courier
          fonts.

          DOWNLOAD by Elfring Soft Fonts is also included in the font set.
          It is included in full registration or it can be registered
          separately.

          Look for DMPLAS.ZIP and DMPLASFN.ZIP on BBSs. $32 registration
          for DMPLAS only. $44 for registration of both DMPLAS and the
          optional soft fonts. Both include current disk and a printed
          manual.
