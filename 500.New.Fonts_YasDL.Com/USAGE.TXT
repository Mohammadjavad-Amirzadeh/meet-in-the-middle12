Notes on using this font:

Shifted capital letters have higher cursive ligatures than unshifted.  
This allows some of the higher characters ("t", "o", etc) to properly connect
with the lower characters.  Hence, the word "Violation" would be properly
typed "VIoLatIoN" in order to get all the ligatures to match.

It's a hack, yes, but I think it looks cooler than having 'em all line 
up the same way.
