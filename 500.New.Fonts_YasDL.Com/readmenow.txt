 |-------------------*  Frequently Asked Questions : *----------------|
   
   » Can I use the fonts for commercial things, such as things I might
     get money for? Can I buy the font/fonts?

   » No!! If you want to do that you'll have to contact me first and
     get my permission. And we must set a deal, how much money I can
     earn from it. You can buy the font, it will cost between $10 - 
     $20 then you'll have the full rights to it.

   » Can I use the fonts on my webpage?

   » Yes, if it's a free webpage. If you aint making any money thru
     it, that means if you make a clickthru banner etc, with my font
     on it, you are making money thru my font. It have to free all 
     over or else it's not allowed.
