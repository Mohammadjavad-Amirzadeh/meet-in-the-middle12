The RabbitEars font is a round, bold '40's type of advertising display font whose letters slightly resemble Cooper Black. Uppercase and lowercase characters are identical in this font, except for B, H, F, K and L, which are far taller than the other characters, forming "rabbit ear" loops at the top (hence the name). All the characters look like lower-case characters. Also in the font is a complete set of numbers and punctuation.On a 300-dpi device, don't print at sizes smaller than 48 points. Because the rabbit-ear capitals are so relatively tall, the "tall" characters in this font (b, d, f, k, etc.) are only 40% of the actual font size and the "short" (a, c, e, m, n, etc.) characters only 22% - - which means printed characters are about half the font size chosen. Because the insides of looped characters (a, d, e, o, etc.) are small, these characters will fill in at smaller sizes.RabbitEars is copyright (c) 1992 by David Rakowski. All Rights Reserved.
