Gessele-Script is an elegant script font from the Art Nouveau period. The characters are unslanted and are drawn as if with a quill pen, with thick down strokes and thin up strokes. There's a complete alphabet in the font, as well as punctuation and numbers. There are no diacritics. There are also three extra characters: an alternate upper-case M will be found at ascii 229 on PCs, shift-option M on Macintosh; a final swash lower-case e at ascii 171 (option-e followed by option-e on Macintosh); and a final swash lower-case n at ascii 247 (option-n followed by option-n on Macintosh). The Macintosh keystrokes given apply to the System 7 keyboard mapping.The Gessele-Script font has been uploaded in PostScript Type 1 and TrueType versions for both Macintosh and PC platforms. Other platforms are not supported. All versions of this font are copyright (c) 1992 by David Rakowski. All Rights Reserved. It is distributed as shareware.
