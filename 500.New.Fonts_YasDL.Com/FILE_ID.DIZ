Tortillon swash serif TTF font [Shareware-ASP]
Version 2.00
The Tortillon typeface is based on the Art Deco 
design school, with a high contrast between block 
and hairline strokes, with the addition of spiral-
shaped swash serifs. It then becomes a bit rococo, 
kitsch, and maybe used for such projects as season's 
cards, titles, packaging, etc.
TTF evaluation sample. 3 fonts in full pack. Lovely 
bears little hearts, and lined is typical of the "tuxedo-
style" of the era.
